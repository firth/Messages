Status Message (April 9):

If you can see this message, you are on an old (broken) version of Weather Radar Pro. This version only works on Windows 10. On Windows 8 and 8.1, it will just show a blank map of the world.

A new version has been submitted to Microsoft for approval. Once it gets approved, your copy of Weather Radar Pro should be automatically updated and this message should go away.

The new version should be approved shortly, but I don't have an exact time to give you.
