Hello from Baton Rouge!

The chat feature of the app is back up. Please email me if you have any questions.

We had 7.5 feet of water in our building for the last couple days. The water is now out, and we have power... Just waiting on AT&T to fix the internet connection. They are taking forever, it seems.

I have enabled a temporary backup. This should restore most services. I'm sorry for the disruption!
