April 5, 2015:

Ordered some parts to fix our server, which are slightly delayed due to Easter. Working on this as quickly as I can. This should be fixed better than ever by Tuesday.

Thank you for your patience! I am committed to keeping this app updated and continuously adding new features. If you are having any problems or have any questions, please email us.
